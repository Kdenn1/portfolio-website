                      <p>
                 My name is Kaeden Wodke and I am a 22 year old full stack developer. I have spent years building computers
                and know my way around hardware at a very high level. I wanted to get more into the software side of computing
                so I enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of Oregon and plan to graduate in October as a full
                stack engineer. I'm a team player and I always put in the extra effort off the clock to assure that I am the most 
                useful and versatile employee. I am a hard worker and a laid back attitude to have in the workplace as I strongly
                believe that lifting people up and assisting them is the way to go as opposed to tearing them down. I can work with
                anybody and I will fill the spot in whatever role you may need.

                While my goal is to have an impressive and overflowing portfolio, right now what I have
                is a published website that I created for the reputable and well-established company RunBuddy.
                The website displays an adaptive and responsive user interface that new and existing customers
                will be able to effortlessly navigate. 
            </p>
